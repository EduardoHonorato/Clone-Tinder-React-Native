# Tinder

I used React Native and Expo for build this app.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the all dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
npm install
```

## Usage
You must have the [expo app](https://expo.io) in your smartphone or emulator.
After instalation the dependencies and expo app, run the command in your terminal

```bash
expo start
```
After that, you will see the QR code in your terminal and web, scan with yout iPhone camera's or expo android app or click open the simulator on web.
Then, the app will be open in your device.
